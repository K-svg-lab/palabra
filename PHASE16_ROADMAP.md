## 🎯 **Phase 16.1 Detailed Plan** (Current Focus)

### **Task 1: POS Verification for Examples** 
**Est. Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Status**: ⏳ TODO

#### **Problem**:
Example sentences may use the word with a different part of speech than detected.

**Example Issue**:
```
Word: "libro" (book)
Detected POS: noun
Example: "Yo libro muchas batallas" (I fight many battles)
Issue: "libro" used as verb here! ❌
```

#### **Solution**:
Parse example sentences and verify word usage matches detected POS.

#### **Implementation Steps**:

**Step 1.1: Create POS Validation Service** (2 hours)
- [ ] Create `lib/services/pos-validation.ts`
- [ ] Implement `validateExamplePOS()` function
- [ ] Use regex patterns for basic POS detection in context
- [ ] Handle Spanish-specific patterns (articles, verb conjugations)

**Step 1.2: Integrate with Dictionary Service** (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Add POS validation to `getCompleteWordData()`
- [ ] Filter examples that fail validation
- [ ] Add `posValidated: boolean` flag to example metadata

**Step 1.3: Add UI Indicators** (1 hour)
- [ ] Show warning icon for unvalidated examples
- [ ] Add tooltip: "POS not verified"

**Step 1.4: Testing** (1 hour)
- [ ] Test with 50+ common words
- [ ] Verify >90% accuracy
- [ ] Document edge cases

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Examples marked as validated/unvalidated
- ✅ >90% accuracy on test set
- ✅ Fallback gracefully if validation fails
- ✅ UI shows validation status

---

### **Task 2: Cross-Validation System**
**Est. Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Status**: ⏳ TODO

#### **Problem**:
When DeepL says "perro" = "dog" but Wiktionary says "hound", users don't know which to trust.

#### **Solution**:
Compare results from multiple APIs and flag discrepancies.

#### **Implementation Steps**:

**Step 2.1: Create Cross-Validation Service** (1.5 hours)
- [ ] Create `lib/services/cross-validation.ts`
- [ ] Implement `compareApiResults()` function
- [ ] Define "disagreement" threshold (e.g., Levenshtein distance > 3)
- [ ] Handle synonyms (dog/hound = agreement)

**Step 2.2: Integrate with Lookup API** (1 hour)
- [ ] Add cross-validation to `/api/vocabulary/lookup`
- [ ] Compare DeepL, MyMemory, Wiktionary results
- [ ] Add `crossValidation` metadata to response

**Step 2.3: Add UI Warnings** (0.5-1 hour)
- [ ] Show warning when APIs disagree
- [ ] Display all API suggestions
- [ ] Let user choose

**Step 2.4: Store Disagreements** (0.5 hour)
- [ ] Log disagreements to database
- [ ] Track resolution (which translation user chose)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Detect disagreements across 3+ APIs
- ✅ Flag >5% of lookups (realistic estimate)
- ✅ UI shows clear warnings
- ✅ Disagreements logged for analysis

**Step 3.1: Research RAE API** (1 hour)
- [ ] Review RAE API documentation
- [ ] Check rate limits and authentication
- [ ] Understand response format
- [ ] Determine if free tier sufficient

**Step 3.2: Create RAE Service** (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Create `lib/services/rae.ts`
- [ ] Implement `getRaeDefinition()` function
- [ ] Parse RAE response format
- [ ] Extract POS, definitions, examples
- [ ] Handle regional variants

**Step 3.3: Integrate with Dictionary Service** (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Add RAE as 4th API source
- [ ] Prioritize RAE for formal definitions
- [ ] Merge RAE data with existing results
- [ ] Add `raeValidated: boolean` flag

**Step 3.4: Update Cross-Validation** (1 hour)
- [ ] Include RAE in cross-validation checks
- [ ] Weight RAE higher (authoritative source)
- [ ] Use RAE as tiebreaker for disagreements

**Step 3.5: Add UI Indicator** (0.5 hour)
- [ ] Show "RAE Verified" badge
- [ ] Link to RAE entry

**Step 3.6: Testing & Error Handling** (1 hour)
- [ ] Test with 100+ words
- [ ] Handle API failures gracefully
- [ ] Add caching for RAE results
- [ ] Monitor API usage

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ RAE integration working for >80% of common words
- ✅ Graceful fallback if RAE unavailable
- ✅ RAE data merged with existing sources
- ✅ UI shows RAE verification status
- ✅ Response time <100ms overhead

## 🚧 **Blockers & Dependencies**

### **Current Blockers**
1. ⚠️ **Localhost hang** - Slows development (see `LOCALHOST_HANG_DEBUG_GUIDE.md`)
2. ⚠️ **Low user count** - Need 100+ users before Phase 16.3

### **External Dependencies**
- RAE API access (may require partnership/payment)
- Sufficient user base for verification data
- Product-market fit validation

### **Technical Debt**
- Local dev environment fix needed
- Analytics infrastructure missing
- No A/B testing framework yet

---

## 📝 **Decision Log**

### **February 5, 2026: Prioritize Quality First**
**Decision**: Implement translation quality improvements (Phase 16.1) before user verification system (Phase 16.3)

**Rationale**: 
- Better to have high-quality translations that aren't verified than low-quality translations that are
- Quality improvements benefit all users immediately
- Verification system requires sufficient user base (not there yet)
- Cross-validation catches issues early

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ❌ Implement Phase 16.3 now - Rejected due to low user count
- ❌ Skip quality improvements - Rejected due to known weaknesses

**Result**: Roadmap restructured with Phase 16.1 (quality) before Phase 16.3 (verification)
