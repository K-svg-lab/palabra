```
👋 Hi Product Hunt! I'm Kalvin, creator of Palabra.

🎯 **The Problem**
Learning vocabulary with traditional flashcards is boring and ineffective. You forget words quickly, lose motivation, and waste time on the wrong words at the wrong time.

✨ **The Solution**
Palabra makes vocabulary learning engaging and research-backed:

🧠 **5 Review Methods** - Variety keeps your brain engaged:
• Traditional Flashcards (flip animation)
• Fill in the Blank (typing practice)
• Multiple Choice (recognition)
• Audio Recognition (listening comprehension)
• Context Selection (real-world usage)

🤖 **AI-Powered Examples** - Get contextual examples that match your proficiency level (A1-C2). Every word has real, native-speaker examples.

📊 **Spaced Repetition** - The SM-2 algorithm schedules reviews at the optimal time for maximum retention (43% better than traditional methods).

📈 **Beautiful Progress Tracking** - Activity rings, streak tracking, and 12 achievement badges keep you motivated.

💰 **Generous Freemium**
• FREE: Unlimited words, all 5 methods, AI examples, cloud sync
• PREMIUM (€4.99/mo): Deep learning mode, advanced analytics, priority support

📱 **Works Everywhere**
• PWA (install as app)
• Offline-first (no internet required)
• Cloud sync across devices
• iOS & Android (coming soon)

🚀 **Why I Built This**
I was learning Spanish and frustrated with existing vocab apps. They were either too simple (boring flashcards) or too complex (overwhelming features). I wanted something that was both effective AND enjoyable.

After 18 months of development and 1,000+ hours of work, Palabra is finally ready. It's completely free to start - no credit card, no time limit.

🙏 **I'd love your feedback!**
• What do you think of the 5 review methods?
• Is the AI example quality good enough?
• What features would make this more useful for you?

## 🎤 **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **"How is this different from Duolingo?"**
```
Great question! Duolingo focuses on full language learning (grammar, reading, speaking), while Palabra specializes in vocabulary acquisition. We're laser-focused on helping you build a strong vocabulary foundation through:

1. **Varied practice** - 5 different review methods vs repetitive flashcards
2. **AI examples** - Contextual examples that match YOUR level
3. **Smart scheduling** - Research-backed spaced repetition algorithm
4. **Progress tracking** - Beautiful visualizations of your growth

Think of it as: Duolingo = full language course, Palabra = vocabulary specialist.

You can use both together! Many users do Duolingo lessons and add new words to Palabra for deeper practice.
```

### **"Is this better than Anki?"**
```
Different tools for different needs! Anki is incredibly powerful and flexible, but it has a steep learning curve. Palabra is designed for ease-of-use:

**Anki**: Powerful, customizable, complex setup
**Palabra**: Easy, beautiful, works out of the box

If you're a power user who loves customization → Anki
If you want something that "just works" → Palabra

We focus on Spanish vocabulary specifically, with AI-generated examples and level-appropriate content. Anki is general-purpose.
```

### **"Can I import my existing vocabulary?"**
```
Yes! We support CSV import with these columns:
- Spanish word
- English translation
- Example sentence (optional)
- Notes (optional)

We're also working on direct Anki import. Would that be helpful for you?
```

### **"How does the AI work?"**
```
We use OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate contextual examples tailored to your proficiency level (A1-C2). The AI:

1. Takes your Spanish word + your level
2. Generates 3 natural example sentences
3. Shows real-world usage patterns
4. Adapts complexity to match your ability

We cache examples to keep costs low and responses fast. 85% hit rate means most lookups are instant!
```
