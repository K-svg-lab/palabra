🎯 Quick Spanish Learning Tip:

Don't translate word-for-word.

Instead, learn words in CONTEXT.

"Aprender" isn't just "to learn"...

See it used:
• "Voy a aprender español" (I'm going to learn Spanish)
• "¿Quieres aprender conmigo?" (Want to learn with me?)

Context = better retention 📚
```

**Feature Highlight**:
```
Why Palabra uses 5 different review methods:

🎴 Traditional Flashcards - Quick recall
✏️ Fill in Blank - Active production  
🎯 Multiple Choice - Recognition
🔊 Audio - Listening comprehension

Variety = engagement + better retention 🧠

Title: The Science Behind Why Spaced Repetition Works for Vocabulary

I spent 18 months building a Spanish vocabulary app and dove deep into the research on spaced repetition. Here's what I learned:

[Educational content about Ebbinghaus, forgetting curve, SM-2 algorithm]

[At the end, naturally mention your app]

Full transparency: I built an app called Palabra that uses these principles. Happy to answer any questions!

**Ask for Feedback**:
```
Title: Built a Spanish vocabulary app with 5 review methods - would love your feedback

Hey r/Spanish! I'm Kalvin, and I've been working on a vocabulary learning app called Palabra for the past year.

The main feature is 5 different review methods (flashcards, fill-blank, multiple choice, audio, context selection) because I found traditional flashcards boring.

Would anyone be willing to try it and give honest feedback? It's completely free.

Specifically looking for feedback on:
- Which review methods you prefer
- If the AI examples are helpful
- What features are missing

Thanks! 🙏
